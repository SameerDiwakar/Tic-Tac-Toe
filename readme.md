# 🎮 Project 17: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple yet strategic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built as part of my **Micro IT Internship** project. This is a classic two-player game where players alternate turns to place their symbol (❌ or ⭕) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
